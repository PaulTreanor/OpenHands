# OpenHands 
OpenHands is a gesture recognition system powered by [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), k-nearest neighbours, and local outlier factor.  Currently the system can identify thumbs up, peace, palm, and out of distribution hand gestures of right hands. 

## :clapper:  Video demo
[Watch a demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSDZ-cdyGXw) of OpenHands being used in the camera web app Jester (app code in /examples directory).
